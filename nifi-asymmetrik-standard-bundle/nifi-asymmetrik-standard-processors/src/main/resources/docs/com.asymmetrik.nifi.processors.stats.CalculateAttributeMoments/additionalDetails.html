<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>
    This processor inspects the flowfile attributes for a specified key that resolves to a number.  For each flowfile containing
    this attribute, and for all flowfile where this attribute resolves to a number, the first two statistical moments are computed.
    That is, the min, max, sum, count, mean, and standard deviation are computed.  Computing these moments efficiently is of paramount
    importance.
