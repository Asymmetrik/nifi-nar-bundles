    <div>
        Calculates the amount of storage space available for Content and Flowfile Repositories, 
        gathers system and JVM statuses, and processor queue sizes, and emits these metrics to Amazon CloudWatch.
    </div>

    <h2 style="padding-bottom:0;margin-bottom: 0;">Current Limitations:</h2>
    <div>
        Due to packaging issues in NiFi, there isn't a sane way to import AWSCredentialsProviderService.
        Including the AWSCredentialsProviderService class in this service redefines the service in NiFi, and makes
        a second copy of the service appear in the service creation list. Due to this issue, this service can only 
        use a DefaultAWSCredentialsProviderChain to connect to CloudWatch.
